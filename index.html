<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>According to The World Bank, World DataBank, Literacy levels among youth (15 – 24 years of age) in 2011 was reported to be 70.4%, while the literacy among Adults (15+ years) was reported at 59.8[1]. Another report by the African Development bank stated that by 2030, majority of the African population will be below 25 years of age [2]. </p>

<a id="problem-statement" class="anchor" href="#problem-statement" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>A lot of young Ugandans today have no idea who Dr. Tom Rushege was, in Rwanda several claim to know who Alexis Kagame is, but outside of Rwanda, few know of him. The story of Gipiri and Labongo, a myth about two brothers who later became the founding fathers of the tribes in Northern Uganda, their story or different versions of it can be found scattered in a few places on the internet, either by bloggers reminiscing of their childhood or by retired missionaries looking to tell about where they have been; Looking to share, the mystery of Africa. </p>

<p>Africa is a continent that despite having 54 different countries, has one thing in common; Oral Tradition! From stories told by grandfathers about the origins of their people, the legends and folk tales embedded with hidden meaning, to young 21st century writers struggling to get their voice out there. This collection of authors has to fight and compete with the likes of Stephanie Meyer, Dan Brown and Tom Clancy on popular eReaders like Amazon’s Kindle, Barnes and Noble’s Nook and GoodReads. More often than not, these African authors loose the fight. </p>

<h2>
<a id="the-solution" class="anchor" href="#the-solution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Solution</h2>

<p>A proposed solution to the problem mentioned above is NituShoma. </p>

<p>NituShoma is an e-Reader that will curate and promote local African content. Local African content refers to literary works that are written by African authors. On NituShoma, African authors will not have to compete with popular authors like Stephanie Meyer but will provide healthy competition for each other. NituShoma will also be a resource that will help foster a sense of cultural identity in an era where Western civilization has become the de facto standard. NituShoma is intended to serve the African Market. This includes the 1 billion[3] people currently living on the African continent as well as the African immigrants living on other continents. </p>

<h3>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works?</h3>

<a id="mobile-phones--africa" class="anchor" href="#mobile-phones--africa" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mobile Phones &amp; Africa</h3>

<p>A lot has been written on the impact Mobile phones have had and are continuing to have in Africa, Palmer [7], mentions that as ICT in general continues to develop, Africa needs to embrace technology in order to reduce the digital divide both in Africa and between Africa and the rest of the world. This technology can be also be the use of Mobile phones and their integration in African Societies. Soltes [8], states that the mobile revolution in Africa has brought on a new attitude. An attitude where even in the poorest of countries the ownership of a mobile phone is seen as not just a means of communication but one of prestige. </p>

<p>This so called mobile revolution can be considered to be a contributing factor to a report written by McKinsey&amp;Company [9]. The report states that in Africa in 2013, there was 16% internet penetration, 167 million internet users, 67 million smartphone users, over 50% of urban residents are online and that 51.6 million are Facebook users. The predict that by 2015, internet penetration would have risen by approximately 50%, there will be 600 million internet users as well as 360 million smartphones. The report goes further to state that even through African are eager to generate demand, governments still have a role to play in educating those that are unaware of the benefits of the internet through the use of digital literacy programmes. </p>

<p>The Business Monitor International Jan 2014 report entitled BMI Africa Telecommunications Outlook: Key Markets and Trends [10], mentions the need for affordable smartphones in Africa’s low income markets that has now become a reality with smartphone companies expanding their local presence and product offerings in the region.</p>

<a id="mobile-money-in-africa" class="anchor" href="#mobile-money-in-africa" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mobile Money in Africa</h3>

<p>With the diffusion of Mobile phones in Africa, there is now an increase in the use of these phones for another important aspect. The phones are now being used for making payments, where instead of people walking around with wads of cash, they are now using their mobile phones as their wallets. Standage of The Economist [11] wrote that countries in the developing world, i.e Kenya, are now using Mobile payments as an alternative convention to banking and payment methods. </p>

<p>Kshetri and Acharya [12] found that as of February 2012, the mobile payment users in Kenya were over 18 million and that mobile banking in Africa was expected to reach $22billion by 2015. They noted that because only 20% of families had bank accounts alternatives such as mobile banking proved much more useful since all that was required was access to a mobile phone. </p>

<h3>
<a id="oral-tradition" class="anchor" href="#oral-tradition" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Oral Tradition</h3>

<p>Ruth Finnegan in her book Oral Literature in Africa [13] mentions that the unwritten forms of African Tradition are less widely known and appreciated, since these forms do not fit into familiar categories of literate cultures. She continues to write that they are harder to records and present to a superficial observer. She distinguishes between oral literature and written literature by noting that oral literature is normally dependent on the performer while written works can take on an independent form as perceived by the reader.</p>
